## Queue Analysis

The example demonstrates how to use VQPy to analyze queue length and waiting time at a checkout counter.
Queue analysis is crucial for retail stores to optimize customer experience and improve operational efficiency.

### Environment preparation
You can follow the instructions [here](../../README.md#installation) to prepare your environment for VQPy.

### Run Example
You can use `python queue_analysis.py` to run the example. Below are the arguments you need to specify.
* `--path`: your own video dataset path.
* `--save_folder`: the folder that you preferred to save the query result.
* `--polygon`: the polygon coordinates of the queue area.
